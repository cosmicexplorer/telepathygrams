* TODO Beat ripgrep by cheating! [0/3]
- [ ] compile [[n-gram index]] of source code files
- [ ] [[query for literal substrings]] of a regex pattern
- [ ] [[watch filesystem and recompute]] n-grams offline!

* n-gram index
- in [[file:ngram-index/src/lib.rs][ngram-index crate]]

** compile the index
- rolling hashes
- associated with literal n-grams
- linked to offsets

** query the index
- find offsets for literals

* query for literal substrings
- extract [[https://docs.rs/regex-syntax/latest/regex_syntax/hir/struct.Literal.html][literals from regex-syntax HIR]]

* watch filesystem and recompute

** watch a directory
- in [[file:watcher/src/main.rs][ngram-watcher crate]]

*** configure watch params
- match specific file paths by regex

*** watcher process
- how to maintain watcher? a daemon?
  - speaking over a socket file like ethersync?
